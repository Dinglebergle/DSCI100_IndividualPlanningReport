    "We will use the players dataset to see if the background of the player can be used to predict how long they would play. This is useful as if more people play for longer, than more licenses will be needed. In order to achieve this, we will predict using \n",
    "k nearest neighbours regression. This is a suitable method as we are predicting a contious variable rather than a discrete one, so we cannot use classificaiton methods. Since we don't know the relationship, and we are also using experience in a numeric form, we don't know if the resulting relationship will be linear. Thus, a knn regression will probably yield more accurate results. A key limitation of this is that we will need to factor in discrete data (experience, gender) into this calculation, although there are ways to format it to make it viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a model by using age, experience (converted to numeric) as our independent variables, and the playtime as our dependent variable. We will then use k nearest neighbour regression to create a model to predict playtime of new players. We will split the data into a training and a testing dataset, so that we can validate our model after we create it. This split will likely be a 60/30 split. For non numeric data, we will convert each unique data value into a number. For experience, we will have beginner as 0.2, and move up in experience until we get pro as 1. This allows us to avoid normalization for this variable. We will have to normalize age to a value between 0 and 1. "
